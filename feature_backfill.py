# 
# We will attach this expectation to the air quality feature group, so that we validate the `pm25` data every time we write a DataFrame to the feature group. We want to prevent garbage-in, garbage-out.

# 

# ## <span style="color:#ff5f27;">‚è≠Ô∏è **Exercises:** 
#  </span> 
# 
# Extra Homework:
# 
#   * Try adding a new feature based on a rolling window of 3 days for 'pm25'
#       * This is not easy, as forecasting more than 1 day in the future, you won't have the previous 3 days of pm25 measurements.
#       * df.set_index("date").rolling(3).mean() is only the start....
#   * Parameterize the notebook, so that you can provide the `country`/`street`/`city`/`url`/`csv_file` as parameters. 
#       * Hint: this will also require making the secret name (`SENSOR_LOCATION_JSON`), e.g., add the street name as part of the secret name. Then you have to pass that secret name as a parameter when running the operational feature pipeline and batch inference pipelines.
#       * After you have done this, collect the street/city/url/csv files for all the sensors in your city or region and you make dashboards for all of the air quality sensors in your city/region. You could even then add a dashboard for your city/region, as done [here for Poland](https://github.com/erno98/ID2223).
# 
# Improve this AI System
#   * As of mid 2024, there is no API call available to download historical data from the AQIN website. You could improve this system by writing a PR to download the CSV file using Python Selenium and the URL for the sensor.
